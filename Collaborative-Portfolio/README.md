# Collaborative-portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to the Collaborative Portfolio Website project! In this project, our team came together to create a shared portfolio website where each of us contributed our unique sections. By working on this project, we gained hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript, all while practicing how to collaborate effectively.

The goal of the project was not only to showcase our individual work but also to create a cohesive site that reflects each of our contributions, while developing essential teamwork skills.

## Project Objective

Our main goals for this project were to:

- Gain practical experience with Git and GitHub in a collaborative team setting.
- Develop and refine our skills with HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.
- Learn how to manage a project, contribute effectively to a team, and use version control properly.
